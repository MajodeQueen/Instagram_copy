        These are apps and websites that are no longer connected to your
        Instagram account. They can't access your non-public information
        anymore, but may still have the information you shared while they were
        active. "Non-public" means information that an app can only access if
        you choose to share it when you log in with your Instagram account (like
        your email address). You can ask an app to delete your information. To
        do it, review their Privacy Policy for details and contact information.
        If you contact an app, they may need your User ID.
